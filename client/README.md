# README
## This is the README for the "turnip" 
-------------------
The extension observes all 'feature' documents
and uses the server to provide validation, definition reference and completion proposals.

The code for the extension is in the 'client' folder. It uses the 'vscode-languageclient' node module to launch the language server.

The language server is located in the 'server' folder.
